# python-mail :star:
 Simple python script to send email

## :question: How to Use ? 

* Clone or Download the Zip File
* Extract Them if You Downloaded and Navigate to Direcctory
* Run by opening Terminal / CMD in the Directory Where **send_mail.py** is located. by ` python sendmail.py ` 
* If you have both python2 and python3 then run with python3 ` python3 sendmail.py `

### :exclamation: Note 

* While using BulkMail enter the path of csv file located along with extension **.csv**
    * For Example : If the CSV File is loacted in `C:\users\username\Documents\list.csv ` And The python Script located in ` C:\users\username\Downloads\python-mail-master\sendmail.py `
    Then the Input to csv file must be `C:\users\username\Documents\list.csv ` :white_check_mark:
    Not ` list.csv ` :x:

TLDR; The Path of the csv file must be absolute
